## Life update

Times I cried, felt lost and everything in between

### 14/06/2023

Today feels horrible. I did nothing all day and I can’t even write fucking css anymore 🤦🏽‍♀️ everything has been feeling frustrating lately. I mean currently, I have 3 jobs, school, numerous tests next week and a competition on Monday (it’s not even a fucking school day). I don’t know shit to write in the competition, I don’t want to fail, winning doesn’t sound enticing either. I just wan Dey my dey, but no one would understand. Not even my best friend understands(I’m that confusing, I know). I haven’t been feeling like this all day though. It started this evening when I was quietly scrolling through Twitter, I don’t know whether Elon musk and the universe were playing with me, but I suddenly saw a lot of people winning. I’m not jealous or anything, I wish them well in all their endeavors but a baby girl has wishes too yk 🙁, and lately it feels I’m good at nothing but multitasking. I’m not “the best” at anything, just mediocre. I’m not the best in school, neither am I the best in tech, I’m just the best in multitasking and juggling 4 different things at a time. I hate that feeling. I just saw Jesse post an epic dump about Samsung’s website and I’m like: “I’m not so good with backend engineering, neither am I the best in Frontend, so where do I fall into? It’s not blockchain, it’s not AI (I don’t know shit there). It’s nothing.” I feel like I’m trying to do so many things at once and I end up achieving nothing. It’s a shitty feeling, trust me. I angrily closed the app and entered my email. The first email I opened was explaining about the recent naira floating that I’ve been finding confusing all morning so I decided to read it. I’m done reading and at the end, guess what I saw? 🙂. I saw an article on how pixelDahn 23xed his incomes and now works at Meta and I’m like, wyd divine? Where were you? So, I read the whole article and I feel even shittier(don’t know if that’s a real word), anyways I left gmail (I can’t delete the app) and entered WhatsApp to respond to messages then go and work. Soon, I decided to stay and talk with bestie. As we were talking, I messed things up and angered her, which also made me angry at myself. And to top it all, I haven’t eaten and I can’t even eat. There’s okpa but I don’t want that. And I can’t go out to get something, it’s 10:50pm. All this has saturated my brain and I can’t even work. I told bestie and she suggested I go offline and clear my head a bit. I cried for 10mins and I know it didn’t work but came back online to convince her it did(I’m surprised she believed me, I guess I’m a good actress ). Now I feel WAY more shittier cause she’s gone to bed now and I’m alone. In conclusion, I feel like shit today. The most shitty I’ve ever felt in a long time. Goodnight. 10:55pm

I feel like shit today again. School pressure is getting worse, career pressure is even worser. God, I’m really tired 😔

### 6/7/2023

Today, was a mixed feelings kind of day. I had school today, and I went home with mmesoma. She asked some personal questions and I answered. After which we prayed. I was surprised to hear that she prays for me daily. A person like me. Someone who is a bad person and friend. I came back feeling worn out and I so much want to sleep but I promised I’d be there when she comes online by 12am. And I also promised to join the prayer by 2am. It’s crazy how she was able to convince 3 of my friends to join the prayer without any of them knowing it was for me. Dad has gone to bring back a curse, and at his age he shouldn’t be doing all that. He’s scared, I understand but he couldn’t have a little faith. I hope God can substitute mine for his and somehow forgives him. That night, I begged God for 5years. 5 more years with dad, and now I wish for more. They have refused to sought for Christian means to cure whatever is wrong with him due to their beliefs in the gods. It’s sad to watch everything unfold without being able to do anything. I’m unable to speak or talk about anything concerning my fathers health. Things like this make me regret staying here but it’s just for a short while. I’m so fucking tired and all I want to do is cuddle with my pillow since there’s no one here who actually listens to me and my emotions. But I’m off to work.

### 1/08/2023

It’s a new month - August. August aren’t really my best months, at the time of writing I feel useless and as though I’m wasting my life. School just closed a few days ago and I’ve been doing nothing with my life other than waking up, washing plates, and reading novels until it’s midnight. I don’t have any motivation to code and I just want to do something useful before waec pressures start. I don’t like feeling this way at all, and I want it to stop, please.

August has felt like hell. Only my lessons make it less of a burden. I’m tired of feeling this way please.

### September 30, 2023

So it’s 9:02 PM I I was scrolling through Twitter and I felt overwhelmed everything that I just felt I felt like I was out of place I felt like I was in a place where I can’t even shout scream and I’m sad I cannot express my feelings so much because I have portrayed this personality of a free person. Of a person who’s doing well in life. Of a person who has no trouble in life but just continuously retweeting posts. And because of this I created a new account I I used a name that I should have gotten on my confirmation date but due to illiteracy in my community I was told it was not a saint’s name. so this personal space is a place where I feel like I can openly express my thoughts because nobody knows me I do tweet whatever I feel like I should tweet. I mean it’s very chaotic rn but that’s a problem that can be fixed.
Right now, I’m sad I can’t meet up with school. Neither am I going anywhere with tech. I feel like I’m at the middle of both and I AM mediocre at both fields. But it ends soon. Very soon divine. Because I will get the top 2 results that school has ever seen. I WILL do it. Because I want to. Then I would take some time off social media and the rest, take a break, gather my skills and enter the job market. I’m tired of asking God why things aren’t working for me. So I’ll MAKE things work for me. Although all I just want is to be happy. Very happy. Is that too much to ask Lord?
